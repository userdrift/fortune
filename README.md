`fortune` is a program that displays a pseudorandom message from google gemini.
this is like the original one created by Ken Arnold, but instead of relying on a database, it uses google gemini to generate a fortune and display it.

Why did i choose Google Gemini over chatgpt or clauude?
At this time, I didnâ€™t have access to a chatgpt api key, and for claude, uhh i genuinely don't know.
